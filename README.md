# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaseen

I'm an aspiring **Cybersecurity professional** with a strong interest in **AI-driven security solutions**. I use this GitHub to document my learning, experiments, and real-world projects as I build toward a career in cybersecurity.

---

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Focus
I’m actively developing skills across:
- Security fundamentals (networks, systems, and threat models)
- Blue team concepts (monitoring, detection, hardening)
- Practical security tooling and automation
- Preparing for industry certifications and real-world security roles

---

## 🤖 AI + Security
I’m especially interested in how **artificial intelligence intersects with cybersecurity**, including:
- AI-assisted threat detection and anomaly analysis
- Automation for security operations (SOAR concepts)
- Using machine learning to improve monitoring, alerts, and response
- Exploring how AI can both strengthen and attack modern systems

Many of my projects explore how AI can **augment security workflows**, not replace human judgment.
